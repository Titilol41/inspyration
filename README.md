# inspyration
A tiny GUI tool to generate drawing prompts

## Requirements
inspyration uses Python 3, with tkinter and PySimpleGUI.

## What is this?
This is a small program written in Python, which randomly picks prompts from [this post](https://salison.tumblr.com/post/135086220266/rather-than-drawing-your-character-standing-there) and [this post](https://salison.tumblr.com/post/173495961931/100-character-interaction-ideas-to-help-hone-your) to help get your inspiration going. For now, it just does that, but I may add more features in the future.

## How does it look?
It uses PySimpleGUI for the GUI:
